# Shopify Data Management & Visualization App

A modern application for efficient management and visualization of Shopify store data, leveraging the Shopify Admin GraphQL API and dynamic Mermaid diagrams.

---

## Overview

This project aims to provide a powerful alternative to the standard Shopify admin interface, focusing on rapid, bulk, and visual data management for store owners, developers, and managers. By exclusively utilizing the Shopify Admin GraphQL API, the application enables tailored data operations and dynamic visualization of store relationships (e.g., Products, Collections, Customers, Orders) through automatically generated Mermaid diagrams.

**Why?**  
The default Shopify UI can be cumbersome for complex or bulk operations and lacks advanced visualization of data relationships. This app addresses those gaps with a streamlined interface and unique diagramming features.

---

## Key Features

- **GraphQL-Driven Data Management:**  
  Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for Products, Variants, Collections, Customers, Orders, and Inventory, all via the Shopify Admin GraphQL API.

- **Dynamic Mermaid Visualizations:**  
  Automatic generation and rendering of Mermaid diagrams (Entity Relationship Diagrams, Class Diagrams) to illustrate the structure and relationships within your Shopify store.

- **Efficient Bulk Operations:**  
  Support for Shopify's Bulk Operations API for high-volume data processing.

- **Authentication:**  
  Secure access via Shopify Admin API Access Token (for personal use) with a modular design to support OAuth for multi-store management in the future.

- **Pagination, Filtering, and Caching:**  
  Handles large datasets with cursor-based pagination, advanced filtering, and caching for performance.

- **Robust Error and Rate Limit Handling:**  
  Adaptive strategies for Shopify's query cost-based rate limiting, with user feedback and retry logic.

- **Extensible Architecture:**  
  Designed for maintainability and future expansion, including multi-client support.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React or Vue.js (web app), or Electron (desktop app)
- **Backend/API:** Node.js (preferred for full-stack JS) or Python (alternative)
- **GraphQL Client:**  
  - Node.js: `@shopify/shopify-api`, `graphql-request`, `urql`, `Apollo Client`  
  - Python: `gql`, `sgqlc`, `Qlient`
- **Visualization:** `mermaid.js` for rendering diagrams
- **Other:**  
  - Electron (if desktop app)
  - Standard web development tools (npm, yarn, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended) or Python 3.8+ (if using Python backend)
- npm or yarn (for JS projects)
- Shopify store with Admin API access

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shopify-data-visualization.git
   cd shopify-data-visualization
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. **Configure Shopify API credentials:**
   - For personal use, create a Custom App in your Shopify admin and obtain the Admin API Access Token.
   - Set the token in your environment variables or configuration file as instructed in `/docs/getting-started.md`.

4. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```
