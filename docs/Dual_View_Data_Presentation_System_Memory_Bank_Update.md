# Dual-View Data Presentation System Memory Bank Update

This document serves as a record of the updates that should be made to the Memory Bank to reflect the design and implementation of the Dual-View Data Presentation System.

## Updates to productContext.md

### Key Features Section

Add the following feature to the Key Features list:
```
* Dual-View Data Presentation System for visualizing hierarchical data structures
```

### Overall Architecture Section

Add the following components to the Overall Architecture list:
```
* **DualViewPresentation**: Main component for the dual-view presentation system
* **TreeVisualization**: Component for rendering hierarchical data in a tree-like structure
* **RawDataView**: Component for displaying raw data in JSON/YAML format
```

### Implementation Phases Section

Add the following phase to the Implementation Phases list:
```
5. **Dual-View Data Presentation System** (In Progress)
   - DualViewPresentation component for toggle functionality
   - TreeVisualization component for hierarchical display
   - RawDataView component for raw data display
   - Integration with ProductManagementDashboard
```

## Updates to activeContext.md

### Current Focus Section

Add the following entry:
```
* Implementing the Dual-View Data Presentation System to enhance developer experience by providing both visual and raw data representations of hierarchical data structures.
```

### Recent Changes Section

Add the following entry:
```
* Created comprehensive design and implementation documentation for the Dual-View Data Presentation System.
* Defined TypeScript interfaces for all components of the system.
* Developed detailed implementation guide with code examples.
* Created user guide for the dual-view system.
```

## Updates to decisionLog.md

Add the following entry:

```
## Decision

* Implement a dual-view data presentation system that toggles between a visual tree representation and raw data format.

## Rationale 

* Developers need both an intuitive visual representation of hierarchical data and access to the underlying raw data.
* A toggle mechanism provides the best of both worlds without cluttering the interface.
* ASCII-based tree visualization is lightweight and compatible with all browsers.
* Syntax-highlighted JSON/YAML provides a familiar format for developers.

## Implementation Details

* Create a modular architecture with separate components for tree visualization and raw data display.
* Implement a toggle controller for switching between views.
* Use the StateManager for efficient data caching.
* Integrate with the ProductManagementDashboard in the section-content area.
```

## Updates to progress.md

### Completed Tasks

Add the following entries:
```
* Created design plan for the Dual-View Data Presentation System.
* Defined TypeScript interfaces for all components.
* Developed implementation guide with code examples.
* Created user guide for the dual-view system.
```

### Current Tasks

Add the following entries:
```
* Implement the DualViewPresentation component.
* Implement the TreeVisualization component.
* Implement the RawDataView component.
* Integrate with the ProductManagementDashboard.
```

### Next Steps

Add the following entries:
```
* Test the dual-view system with various data structures.
* Gather user feedback and iterate on the design.
* Enhance the system with search and filtering capabilities.
```

## Updates to systemPatterns.md

### Coding Patterns

Add the following entry:
```
* **Component-Based Architecture**: The Dual-View Data Presentation System follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns. Each component (DualViewPresentation, TreeVisualization, RawDataView, ToggleController) has a single responsibility and communicates through well-defined interfaces.
```

### Architectural Patterns

Add the following entry:
```
* **Toggle Pattern**: The Dual-View Data Presentation System uses a toggle pattern to switch between different representations of the same data. This pattern is useful when multiple views of the same data are needed but showing them simultaneously would clutter the interface.
