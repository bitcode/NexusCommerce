# Backend Documentation Review: Findings & Implementation TODO List

## 1. Summary of Findings

### A. Missing Implementations
- Not all resource types (content, metaobjects, menus) have full transformer implementations; only products and collections are detailed.
- YAML serialization in transformers is a placeholder and not actually implemented.
- The actual GraphQL query definitions for each resource type are not present in the reviewed documentation.
- No explicit handling of Shopify Storefront API rate limits (throttling, backoff, retry logic) in the StorefrontApiClient.
- Token refresh/rotation and secure management are not covered.

### B. Inconsistencies and Gaps
- "Next Steps" sections in several docs reference work that may not be complete (e.g., query definitions, testing).
- Error handling is basic; there is no mention of custom error classes, error codes, or partial failure handling.
- Testing documentation lacks concrete test cases, fixtures, and coverage requirements.
- No explicit list of backend API endpoints, expected inputs/outputs, or error codes.
- Security, compliance, and operational concerns (deployment, monitoring) are not addressed.

## 2. Backend Implementation TODO List

### 1. Complete Data Transformers
- [ ] Implement transformers for all resource types: content, metaobjects, menus.
- [ ] Implement proper YAML serialization (e.g., using js-yaml).

### 2. Define and Document GraphQL Queries
- [ ] Create and document all GraphQL queries for each resource type.
- [ ] Add versioning and update strategies for queries.

### 3. Enhance StorefrontApiClient
- [ ] Add rate limit handling (throttling, backoff, retry logic).
- [ ] Implement token refresh/rotation and secure management.
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring hooks for API errors and suspicious activity.

### 4. Expand Error Handling
- [ ] Define custom error classes and error codes for backend operations.
- [ ] Add handling for partial failures and incomplete data.

### 5. Improve Testing Documentation and Coverage
- [ ] Provide concrete test cases, mock data, and expected results for all backend components.
- [ ] Define test coverage requirements and integrate with CI/CD.

### 6. Clarify Backend API Contracts
- [ ] List all backend endpoints, expected inputs/outputs, and error codes.
- [ ] Document frontend/backend data flow assumptions.

### 7. Address Security and Compliance
- [ ] Add documentation for secure token management and environment variable handling.
- [ ] Address compliance (GDPR, PII) and Shopify security rejection handling.

### 8. Operational Readiness
- [ ] Add documentation for deployment, environment setup, and monitoring/alerting.

**Next Steps:**  
Work through the above TODOs one by one, documenting and implementing each as we go.
