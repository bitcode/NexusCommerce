feat(DualViewHierarchy): Add node selection and detail view

Implements functionality to select individual nodes within the hierarchy presentation view and display their details in a separate card.

- Added `selectedNode` state to track the currently selected node.
- Created `handleNodeSelect` function to update `selectedNode` when a node's name/label is clicked.
- Separated click handlers:
    - The expand/collapse icon (`▶`/`▼`) now handles node expansion/collapse via `toggleNode` and uses `stopPropagation`.
    - The node name/label `<span>` now handles node selection via `handleNodeSelect`.
- Added a conditional "Detail Card" section that renders when `selectedNode` is not null.
- The Detail Card displays:
    - The selected node's name/ID.
    - A presentation view snippet of the selected node using `renderTreeNode`.
    - A raw data view snippet using `JSON.stringify`.
    - A close button to set `selectedNode` back to null.
- Minor style adjustments for click targets and spacing.
