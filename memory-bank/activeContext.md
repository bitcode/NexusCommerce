# Active Context

[2025-04-17 11:35:00] - Implemented a comprehensive terminal logging system to diagnose navigation issues in the Nexus Commerce application. The implementation includes:

1. Server-side logging mechanism:
   - Created a simple Express server (`simple-server.js`) that receives logs from the React application
   - Implemented endpoints for different types of logs (navigation, clicks, errors, warnings, info)
   - Added color-coded terminal output for better visibility

2. Client-side logging service:
   - Implemented a TypeScript service (`src/services/LoggingService.ts`) for the React app
   - Created methods for different log types (logNavigation, logClick, logError, etc.)
   - Added fallback to console logging if server communication fails

3. Component integration:
   - Updated Navigation.tsx, Layout.tsx, and App.tsx to use the logging service
   - Added detailed logging at each step of the navigation flow
   - Implemented UI debug panels to show navigation state directly in the interface
   - Added data-testid attributes for easier testing

4. Testing tools:
   - Created an HTML test page (`test-logging.html`) with buttons to test different log types
   - Added a JavaScript test script (`test-logging.js`) to verify server communication
   - Provided comprehensive documentation in README-TERMINAL-LOGGING.md

This implementation helps diagnose the navigation issue by showing the complete flow from click to view change, making it easier to identify where the navigation chain might be breaking. The logs show whether navigation items have onClick handlers and whether those handlers are being called properly.

[2025-04-17 10:12:42] - Identified and documented a navigation issue in the Nexus Commerce application. Created a troubleshooting plan to fix the problem where navigation links are not working. The plan is documented in `docs/Navigation_Issue_Troubleshooting_Plan.md`. Key findings include:

1. Syntax errors in Navigation.tsx:
   - HTML tag mismatches where `<button>` elements are incorrectly closed with `</a>` tags
   - This breaks the event handling chain, preventing navigation

2. Navigation item discrepancies:
   - Inconsistencies between navigation items in Layout.tsx and App.tsx
   - Missing view handler for "Collections" in the renderContent function

The next step is to implement the fixes outlined in the troubleshooting plan by switching to Code mode.

[2025-04-16 18:53:00] - Implemented dashboard integration with StorefrontApiClient. This completes a significant portion of Phase 4 of the Storefront API integration plan. The implementation includes:

1. Updated ProductManagementDashboard to use StorefrontApiClient:
   - Added StorefrontApiClient as a constructor parameter
   - Implemented dual API support (Admin API and Storefront API)
   - Created methods to fetch metrics from both APIs
   - Added specialized data fetching for each section
   - Implemented proper error handling and fallbacks

2. Enhanced DualViewPresentation component:
   - Updated to support both Admin API and Storefront API data
   - Added API client properties to the interface
   - Implemented conditional data fetching based on available clients
   - Added proper error handling and fallbacks to placeholder data

3. Key features implemented:
   - Combined metrics from both APIs for a comprehensive dashboard
   - Direct integration with the new GraphQL query definitions
   - Proper error handling with fallback mechanisms
   - Type-safe integration between components

The next phase of the integration plan is to implement comprehensive testing for the dashboard integration, add error handling and notifications, and implement performance optimizations for large datasets.

[2025-04-16 18:43:00] - Implemented GraphQL query definitions for Storefront API resources. This completes Phase 3 of the Storefront API integration plan. The implementation includes:

1. StorefrontQueries.ts - Common utilities for all Storefront API queries that:
   - Applies the `@inContext` directive for localization
   - Extracts pagination information from responses
   - Extracts nodes from GraphQL edges
   - Provides utilities for fetching all pages of paginated data
   - Handles error processing for GraphQL responses

2. Resource-specific query definitions:
   - ProductQueries.ts - Queries for products, variants, and recommendations
   - CollectionQueries.ts - Queries for collections and products within collections
   - ContentQueries.ts - Queries for pages, blogs, and articles
   - MetaobjectQueries.ts - Queries for metaobject definitions and instances
   - MenuQueries.ts - Queries for navigation menus and shop information

3. Key features implemented:
   - Operation names for all queries to improve debugging and tracing
   - Structured variables with proper typing
   - Comprehensive field selection for complete data access
   - Support for cursor-based pagination
   - Fragment support for reusable query parts
   - Inline documentation for all queries and parameters

4. Example code demonstrating:
   - Basic query execution with StorefrontApiClient
   - Context-aware queries for localization
   - Pagination handling for large datasets
   - Error handling for GraphQL responses
   - Extracting and processing query results

The next phase of the integration plan is to update the ProductManagementDashboard to use these query definitions with the StorefrontApiClient, implement comprehensive testing, and add error handling and notifications in the dashboard.

[2025-04-16 18:25:00] - Planning implementation of GraphQL query definitions for Storefront API resources. Based on the Storefront API Integration Summary and roadmap, this is Phase 3 of the integration plan. Key tasks include:

1. Creating structured GraphQL query definitions for:
   - Products and variants
   - Collections
   - Pages and articles
   - Shop information

2. Implementing context-aware queries with the `@inContext` directive for:
   - Language localization
   - Country/currency selection
   - Content presentation

3. Adding pagination support with:
   - Cursor-based pagination using `after` and `first` parameters
   - "Load more" functionality in the UI
   - Efficient data fetching for large datasets

4. Implementing error handling for GraphQL responses:
   - Detecting errors in successful HTTP responses (200 OK)
   - Providing meaningful error messages
   - Graceful degradation when errors occur

This phase follows the completed data transformer implementation and will enable the dashboard to fetch and display real Storefront API data.

[2025-04-16 17:50:15] - Implemented Storefront API data transformers for the nexusCommerce project. The implementation includes:

1. StorefrontProductsTransformer - A specialized transformer for Storefront API product data that:
   - Converts GraphQL edges/nodes to TreeNode format
   - Handles product variants, images, and options
   - Supports pagination with "Load More" nodes
   - Provides both tree and raw data views

2. StorefrontCollectionsTransformer - A specialized transformer for Storefront API collection data that:
   - Converts GraphQL edges/nodes to TreeNode format
   - Maintains relationships between collections and products
   - Handles collection images and descriptions
   - Supports pagination with "Load More" nodes

3. StorefrontDataTransformerFactory - A factory for creating Storefront API transformers that:
   - Creates the appropriate transformer for each Storefront API section
   - Provides a consistent interface for transformer creation
   - Integrates with the existing DataTransformerFactory

4. StorefrontTransformerUtils - Shared utility functions for Storefront API transformers that:
   - Extract nodes from GraphQL edges
   - Handle pagination information
   - Create relationships between nodes
   - Convert data to different formats (JSON, YAML)

5. Example Code - Added example code demonstrating transformer usage with sample data.

This implementation completes the data transformer phase of the Storefront API integration plan. The next step is to implement the GraphQL query definitions for each resource type.
