# Decision Log

[2025-04-17 11:35:00] - Decisions for implementing terminal logging system for navigation issue diagnosis

**Decision**: Implement a comprehensive terminal logging system to diagnose navigation issues in the Nexus Commerce application.

**Rationale**:
1. Visibility - Browser console logs are ephemeral and can be lost on page refresh
2. Centralization - Terminal logs provide a centralized view of the entire navigation flow
3. Traceability - Logging the complete chain of events helps identify where navigation breaks
4. Persistence - Terminal logs persist even if the browser is closed or refreshed
5. Debugging - Detailed logs with timestamps and context help diagnose complex issues

**Implementation Details**:
1. Create a simple Express server to receive and display logs in the terminal
2. Implement a TypeScript logging service for the React application
3. Update Navigation, Layout, and App components to use the logging service
4. Add UI debug panels to show navigation state directly in the interface
5. Create test tools to verify the logging functionality
6. Provide comprehensive documentation for setup and usage

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Browser console logging - Rejected due to lack of persistence and centralization
2. Third-party logging services - Rejected for simplicity and privacy concerns
3. File-based logging - Considered but requires additional setup and permissions
4. Redux middleware logging - Rejected as the application doesn't use Redux

**Implications**:
1. Improved visibility into the navigation flow across components
2. Better diagnosis of where the navigation chain is breaking
3. Persistent logs that survive page refreshes and browser restarts
4. Foundation for more comprehensive application monitoring
5. Slight increase in network traffic due to logging requests

5. Implemented conditional data fetching based on available clients

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Separate dashboards for each API - Rejected due to duplication and fragmented user experience
2. Middleware layer to unify data - Considered but deferred as unnecessary complexity at this stage
3. Complete replacement of Admin API with Storefront API - Rejected as each API has unique capabilities
4. Client-side API switching - Rejected due to security concerns with exposing tokens

**Implications**:
1. More comprehensive dashboard with data from both APIs
2. Improved resilience through fallback mechanisms
3. Consistent user experience across different data sources
4. Foundation for more advanced features in the future
5. Slightly increased complexity in component interfaces

[2025-04-16 18:43:00] - Implementation decisions for Storefront API GraphQL query definitions

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive GraphQL query definitions with modular file structure, utility functions, and example code.

**Rationale**:
1. Maintainability - Separate files for different resource types improve organization and maintainability
2. Reusability - Common utilities in a shared file reduce code duplication
3. Discoverability - Consistent naming patterns make queries easier to find and use
4. Documentation - Inline documentation improves developer experience
5. Example-driven - Example code demonstrates proper usage patterns

**Implementation Details**:
1. Created StorefrontQueries.ts with common utilities for context directives and pagination
2. Implemented resource-specific query files (Products, Collections, Content, Metaobjects, Menus)
3. Used consistent naming patterns for all queries (e.g., STOREFRONT_PRODUCTS_QUERY)
4. Added comprehensive field selection to minimize the need for query modifications
5. Implemented utility functions for extracting nodes and handling pagination
6. Created an example file demonstrating usage of all query types

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Single file for all queries - Rejected due to maintainability concerns with large file size
2. Auto-generated queries from schema - Considered but requires additional tooling and setup
3. Query builder pattern - Deferred to future enhancement for more dynamic query construction
4. Custom DSL for queries - Too complex for current requirements

**Implications**:
