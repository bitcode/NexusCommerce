# Decision Log

This file tracks significant architectural and design decisions made during the project.

*

## Architectural Decisions

* [2025-04-15 15:38:24] - **Adopted Layered Architecture**: Implemented a clear separation between data access, business logic, and presentation layers to improve maintainability and testability.

* [2025-04-15 18:30:33] - **Implemented StateManager with Privacy Controls**: Created a state management system with built-in data privacy features to ensure sensitive information is not cached, addressing potential security concerns.

* [2025-04-15 18:30:33] - **Adopted Configurable Refresh Policies**: Implemented configurable cache refresh policies to handle different data volatility needs, allowing for fine-grained control over caching behavior.

* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - **Created Standardized CRUD Operations**: Implemented a DataOperations class that provides standardized CRUD operations for all Shopify resources, ensuring consistent API usage patterns.

* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - **Implemented Optimistic Updates**: Added support for optimistic updates in the MutationManager to improve perceived performance and user experience.

* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - **Adopted Strong TypeScript Typing**: Implemented comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all Shopify resources to improve type safety and developer experience.

* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - **Designed Comprehensive Product Ecosystem Management System**: Created a modular architecture for managing all aspects of the Shopify product ecosystem, including products, collections, inventory, content, metaobjects, files, and menus.

* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - **Separated Data Operations from UI Rendering**: Implemented a clear separation between data operations and UI rendering to allow for framework-agnostic usage and easier testing.

* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - **Adopted Component-Based UI Architecture**: Created reusable UI components for common patterns like lists, forms, and modals to improve consistency and reduce duplication.

* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - **Implemented Dynamic Query Generation**: Created a system for dynamically generating GraphQL queries based on resource types and options to reduce boilerplate and improve maintainability.

## Technology Choices

* [2025-04-15 15:38:24] - **Selected TypeScript**: Chose TypeScript for its strong typing system, which helps catch errors at compile time and improves code quality.

* [2025-04-15 15:38:24] - **Adopted GraphQL for API Interaction**: Selected GraphQL for its flexibility in querying exactly the data needed, reducing over-fetching and improving performance.

* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - **Used UUID for Unique Identifiers**: Adopted UUID for generating unique identifiers for operations to ensure uniqueness across distributed systems.

* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - **Framework-Agnostic Core**: Designed the core functionality to be framework-agnostic, allowing for integration with various frontend frameworks.

## Design Patterns

* [2025-04-15 18:30:33] - **Observer Pattern for Notifications**: Implemented the Observer pattern for the notification system to allow components to subscribe to notifications.

* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - **Repository Pattern for Data Access**: Adopted the Repository pattern for data access to abstract the details of data retrieval and manipulation.

* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - **Strategy Pattern for Validation**: Implemented the Strategy pattern for validation to allow for different validation strategies based on resource types.

* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - **Facade Pattern for API Client**: Used the Facade pattern for the ShopifyApiClient to provide a simplified interface to the complex Shopify API.

* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - **Command Pattern for Mutations**: Implemented the Command pattern for mutations to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action.

## Trade-offs and Considerations

* [2025-04-15 18:30:33] - **Cache Invalidation Complexity vs. Performance**: Accepted the complexity of cache invalidation to gain the performance benefits of caching. Implemented pattern-based invalidation to balance precision and simplicity.

* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - **Generic vs. Specific Operations**: Chose to implement generic CRUD operations that work across all resource types, trading some type specificity for code reuse and consistency.

* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - **HTML String Generation vs. Framework Integration**: Decided to generate HTML strings for UI components to maintain framework independence, acknowledging the trade-off in terms of direct DOM manipulation capabilities.

* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - **Comprehensive vs. Focused Resource Management**: Opted for a comprehensive approach to resource management, covering all aspects of the Shopify product ecosystem, despite the increased initial development effort.

* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - **Client-Side vs. Server-Side Processing**: Chose to implement client-side processing for filtering and sorting in some cases to reduce API load, acknowledging the trade-off in terms of client-side performance.
