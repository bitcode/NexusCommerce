## Project Goal

Create a comprehensive Node.js/TypeScript library for real-time monitoring and management of Shopify API usage, with a focus on rate limit tracking, analytics, proactive notifications, efficient state management with data privacy controls, and developer-friendly data operations.

## Key Features

* Centralized API Client for all Shopify Admin GraphQL API calls
* Real-time Rate Limit Monitoring to track available points
* Usage Analytics to track and visualize API usage patterns
* In-app Notifications for rate limit alerts and API usage events
* Plan Configuration for different Shopify plans with appropriate thresholds
* Automatic Throttling & Backoff for rate-limited requests
* Efficient State Management with intelligent caching and data privacy controls
* Dashboard Components for displaying analytics and notifications
* Full CRUD Operations for all Shopify resources with validation
* Optimistic Updates for better user experience
* React Integration for seamless integration with React applications
* Comprehensive Product Ecosystem Management for Products, Collections, Inventory, and more

## Overall Architecture

* **ShopifyApiClient**: Handles all API calls with built-in rate limit tracking
* **UsageAnalytics**: Tracks and analyzes API usage patterns over time
* **PlanConfig**: Manages Shopify plan configuration and associated rate limits
* **NotificationSystem**: Provides in-app notifications for rate limit alerts
* **StateManager**: Implements efficient caching with data privacy controls
* **DashboardComponents**: Framework-agnostic UI components for visualization
* **DataOperations**: Provides standardized CRUD operations for all Shopify resources
* **MutationManager**: Handles optimistic updates and error recovery for mutations
* **ValidationService**: Validates data against schemas before sending to the API
* **React Integration**: Hooks and components for seamless React integration
* **ProductManagementDashboard**: Entry point for comprehensive product ecosystem management
* **ProductsManager**: Handles product CRUD operations and variant management
* **CollectionsManager**: Handles collection CRUD operations and product associations
* **InventoryManager**: Handles inventory operations, transfers, and location management

## Implementation Phases

1. **Core Data Operations Layer** (Completed)
   - DataOperations class for standardized CRUD operations
   - MutationManager for optimistic updates
   - ValidationService for data validation
   - ShopifyResourceTypes for type definitions

2. **Product Ecosystem Management** (Completed)
   - ProductManagementDashboard as entry point
   - ProductsManager for product operations
   - CollectionsManager for collection operations
   - InventoryManager for inventory operations
   - UI components for product ecosystem management

3. **React Integration** (In Progress)
   - React hooks for data querying and mutations
   - React components for common UI patterns
   - Example React application

4. **Framework-Agnostic Enhancements** (Planned)
   - Improve core API for better developer experience
   - Create adapter pattern for other frameworks
   - Enhance documentation with framework-specific examples

5. **Developer Tools** (Planned)
   - DevConsole for debugging
   - SchemaExplorer for metadata
   - OperationBuilder for query/mutation generation

6. **Documentation and Examples** (Ongoing)
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Example applications
   - Interactive tutorials
