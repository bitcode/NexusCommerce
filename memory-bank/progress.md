[2025-04-17 11:35:00] - Implemented terminal logging system for navigation issue diagnosis

**Task**: Create a terminal logging system to diagnose navigation issues in the Nexus Commerce application

**Status**: Completed

**Components Created**:
1. `simple-server.js` - Express server for receiving and displaying logs in the terminal
2. `src/services/LoggingService.ts` - TypeScript service for sending logs from React to the server
3. `test-logging.html` - HTML page with buttons to test different types of logs
4. `test-logging.js` - JavaScript script to test the logging functionality
5. `README-TERMINAL-LOGGING.md` - Documentation for the terminal logging system

**Components Updated**:
1. `Navigation.tsx` - Added logging for navigation events and button clicks
2. `Layout.tsx` - Added logging for navigation item handling
3. `App.tsx` - Added logging for view changes and navigation flow

**Features Implemented**:
- Server-side logging with color-coded terminal output
- Client-side logging service with different log types (navigation, click, error, warning, info)
- UI debug panels showing navigation state directly in the interface
- Comprehensive documentation with setup instructions and troubleshooting tips
- Test tools for verifying the logging functionality

**Next Steps**:
1. Use the terminal logging system to identify the exact cause of the navigation issue
2. Fix the identified issues in the navigation components
3. Verify the fixes using the terminal logs
4. Update documentation with the resolution

**Lessons Learned**:
1. Terminal logging provides better visibility than browser console for debugging
2. Centralized logging makes it easier to track the flow across components
3. Visual debug panels in the UI complement terminal logs for faster diagnosis
4. Test tools are essential for verifying logging functionality

[2025-04-17 10:14:05] - Identified and documented navigation issue in Nexus Commerce application

**Task**: Troubleshoot navigation issue where links are not working

**Status**: In Progress

**Components Analyzed**:
1. `Navigation.tsx` - Found HTML tag mismatches where `<button>` elements are incorrectly closed with `</a>` tags
2. `Layout.tsx` - Examined how navigation items are passed and handled
3. `App.tsx` - Analyzed the view rendering logic and navigation item definitions
4. `ProductCollection.tsx` - Reviewed how products are displayed
5. `CollectionHierarchy.tsx` - Reviewed how collections are displayed

**Issues Identified**:
- Syntax errors in Navigation.tsx (HTML tag mismatches)
- Navigation item discrepancies between Layout.tsx and App.tsx
- Missing view handler for "Collections" in the renderContent function in App.tsx

**Documentation Created**:
- Created `docs/Navigation_Issue_Troubleshooting_Plan.md` with detailed analysis and implementation plan

**Next Steps**:
1. Switch to Code mode to implement the fixes outlined in the troubleshooting plan
2. Fix syntax errors in Navigation.tsx
3. Add debugging logs to track the event flow
4. Ensure navigation items are consistent between components
5. Add missing view handler for "Collections"
6. Test navigation functionality after fixes

**Lessons Learned**:
1. HTML tag mismatches can break event handling chains
2. Consistent navigation items across components are essential
3. Every navigation item needs a corresponding view handler
4. Proper debugging is crucial for troubleshooting UI issues

3. Implement performance optimizations for large datasets
4. Update documentation with usage examples

**Lessons Learned**:
1. Proper interface design is crucial for component integration
2. Fallback mechanisms improve resilience
3. Combining data from multiple sources requires careful handling
4. TypeScript helps catch integration issues early
