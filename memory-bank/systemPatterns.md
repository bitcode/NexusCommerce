# System Patterns

This file documents the architectural and design patterns used in the project, along with their implementation details and rationale.

*

## Architectural Patterns

### Layered Architecture
* **Implementation**: The system is divided into distinct layers: data access (API client), business logic (managers), and presentation (UI components).
* **Rationale**: Separation of concerns improves maintainability, testability, and allows for independent evolution of each layer.
* **Example**: `ShopifyApiClient` handles data access, `ProductsManager` contains business logic, and `ProductsManagerUI` handles presentation.
* [2025-04-15 15:38:24] - Established as core architectural pattern.

### Repository Pattern
* **Implementation**: `DataOperations` class abstracts the details of data retrieval and manipulation from the rest of the system.
* **Rationale**: Provides a clean API for data access, hides the complexity of GraphQL queries, and allows for easier testing through mocking.
* **Example**: `dataOperations.read(ShopifyResourceType.PRODUCT, options)` abstracts the details of fetching products.
* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - Implemented as part of the Data Operations Layer.

### Facade Pattern
* **Implementation**: `ShopifyApiClient` provides a simplified interface to the complex Shopify API.
* **Rationale**: Hides the complexity of API calls, rate limit tracking, and error handling behind a simple interface.
* **Example**: `apiClient.request(query, variables)` handles all the details of making a GraphQL request.
* [2025-04-15 15:38:24] - Implemented as core API client pattern.

### Observer Pattern
* **Implementation**: `NotificationSystem` allows components to subscribe to notifications about rate limits and API usage.
* **Rationale**: Decouples notification generation from notification handling, allowing for flexible notification strategies.
* **Example**: `notificationSystem.notify(message, type, topic)` notifies all subscribers about an event.
* [2025-04-15 15:38:24] - Implemented for notification system.

### Command Pattern
* **Implementation**: `MutationManager` encapsulates all information needed to perform a mutation in a command object.
* **Rationale**: Allows for tracking, queuing, and potentially retrying mutations, as well as implementing optimistic updates.
* **Example**: `mutationManager.addMutation({ type: 'create', resourceType: ShopifyResourceType.PRODUCT, input: productData })`.
* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - Implemented for mutation management.

### Strategy Pattern
* **Implementation**: `ValidationService` uses different validation strategies based on resource types.
* **Rationale**: Allows for flexible validation rules that can be changed at runtime based on the resource being validated.
* **Example**: `validationService.validate(ShopifyResourceType.PRODUCT, productData)` uses product-specific validation rules.
* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - Implemented for data validation.

### Module Pattern
* **Implementation**: Each major feature is encapsulated in its own module with a clear API.
* **Rationale**: Improves code organization, maintainability, and allows for independent development of features.
* **Example**: `ProductsManager`, `CollectionsManager`, and `InventoryManager` are separate modules.
* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - Implemented for product ecosystem management.

## Design Patterns

### Factory Method
* **Implementation**: `DataOperations` creates appropriate GraphQL queries based on resource types and options.
* **Rationale**: Encapsulates the logic for creating complex GraphQL queries, making it easier to maintain and extend.
* **Example**: `dataOperations.createReadQuery(ShopifyResourceType.PRODUCT, options)`.
* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - Implemented for query generation.

### Adapter Pattern
* **Implementation**: `StateManager` adapts different storage mechanisms (memory, localStorage, etc.) to a common interface.
* **Rationale**: Allows for flexible storage strategies without changing the rest of the system.
* **Example**: `stateManager.setItem(key, value, options)` works the same regardless of the underlying storage.
* [2025-04-15 18:30:33] - Implemented for state management.

### Decorator Pattern
* **Implementation**: `ShopifyApiClient` decorates API requests with rate limit tracking and throttling.
* **Rationale**: Adds functionality to API requests without modifying their core behavior.
* **Example**: `apiClient.request(query, variables)` automatically tracks rate limits and throttles requests if needed.
* [2025-04-15 15:38:24] - Implemented for API client.

### Composite Pattern
* **Implementation**: UI components can be composed to create complex interfaces.
* **Rationale**: Allows for flexible UI composition and reuse of common UI patterns.
* **Example**: `renderProductsListHTML()` and `renderProductFormHTML()` can be composed to create a product management interface.
* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - Implemented for UI components.

### Template Method
* **Implementation**: `DataOperations` defines the template for CRUD operations, with specific steps implemented by subclasses.
* **Rationale**: Provides a consistent structure for CRUD operations while allowing for resource-specific customization.
* **Example**: `dataOperations.read()` defines the general flow, but specific query generation is handled by resource-specific methods.
* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - Implemented for data operations.

## Data Patterns

### Cache-Aside
* **Implementation**: `StateManager` implements a cache-aside pattern for data retrieval.
* **Rationale**: Improves performance by caching frequently accessed data, while still allowing for fresh data when needed.
* **Example**: `stateManager.getItem(key, options)` checks the cache first, then falls back to the API if needed.
* [2025-04-15 18:30:33] - Implemented for state management.

### Event Sourcing
* **Implementation**: `UsageAnalytics` records all API usage events for later analysis.
* **Rationale**: Allows for detailed analysis of API usage patterns over time.
* **Example**: `usageAnalytics.recordApiCall(endpoint, points, success)` records each API call.
* [2025-04-15 15:38:24] - Implemented for usage analytics.

### Data Transfer Object (DTO)
* **Implementation**: `ShopifyResourceTypes` defines DTOs for all Shopify resources.
* **Rationale**: Provides a clear contract for data exchange between the API and the application.
* **Example**: `Product`, `Collection`, and `InventoryItem` interfaces define the structure of Shopify resources.
* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - Implemented for resource types.

### Optimistic Updates
* **Implementation**: `MutationManager` supports optimistic updates for mutations.
* **Rationale**: Improves perceived performance by updating the UI immediately, then reconciling with the server response.
* **Example**: `mutationManager.addMutation({ optimisticUpdate: true, ... })` enables optimistic updates for a mutation.
* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - Implemented for mutations.

## UI Patterns

### Component-Based UI
* **Implementation**: UI is composed of reusable components with clear responsibilities.
* **Rationale**: Improves maintainability, reusability, and consistency of the UI.
* **Example**: `renderProductsListHTML()`, `renderProductFormHTML()`, and `renderDeleteConfirmationHTML()` are reusable UI components.
* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - Implemented for product ecosystem management UI.

### Responsive Design
* **Implementation**: UI components use responsive design principles to work on different screen sizes.
* **Rationale**: Ensures a good user experience across devices.
* **Example**: CSS uses relative units, flexbox, and media queries for responsive layouts.
* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - Implemented for UI components.

### Progressive Disclosure
* **Implementation**: Complex UI elements are initially hidden and revealed as needed.
* **Rationale**: Reduces cognitive load by showing only what's necessary at each step.
* **Example**: Collection rules are initially hidden and revealed when creating a smart collection.
* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - Implemented for complex forms.

### Form Validation
* **Implementation**: Forms include client-side validation with clear error messages.
* **Rationale**: Provides immediate feedback to users and prevents invalid data submission.
* **Example**: Product forms validate required fields and show error messages.
* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - Implemented for forms.

## Integration Patterns

### Dependency Injection
* **Implementation**: Dependencies are injected into components rather than created internally.
* **Rationale**: Improves testability, flexibility, and allows for easier mocking of dependencies.
* **Example**: `ProductsManager` receives `apiClient`, `stateManager`, and `mutationManager` as constructor parameters.
* [2025-04-15 19:21:25] - Implemented for all components.

### Adapter Pattern for Framework Integration
* **Implementation**: Framework-specific adapters translate between the core library and framework-specific APIs.
* **Rationale**: Allows for integration with different frameworks without modifying the core library.
* **Example**: React hooks adapt the core library to React's component lifecycle.
* [2025-04-15 21:11:32] - Planned for framework integration.
